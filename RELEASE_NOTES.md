# DLSS 5 Studio v1.0.6 ⚡

### RTX 30 fork integration

- Integrates upstream Studio 1.0.6 while retaining the fork's experimental RTX 30 backend and deployment/recovery protections.
- Updates DLSSG SM86 to pinned 0.3.4 (`196fcb61ef414992a6bef2d237ff609aab09f0d9`) with individually verified forwarding DLLs and notices. Upstream 0.3.4 fixes an RTX 30 driver-reset issue involving NVIDIA App DLSS overrides / NGX model updates.
- Recognizes managed 0.3.3 DLLs for in-place upgrade, rollback, and removal; new payloads must match 0.3.4. Failed upgrades recover the old installation.
- Restores the installed SM86 multiplier in the game sheet. Renderer **Force Override** does not bypass GPU/API/native-FG, integrity, ownership, or recovery checks.
- RTX 30 support remains experimental; see [setup and validation](docs/RTX30-SM86.md).

> **Route advisory engine, high-contrast incompatibility warnings, unrestricted force override deployment, automatic deployment state reflection, and intelligent optimal path selection.**

### 🚀 Highlights & Improvements

- **Route Advisory & Force Override Engine**:
  - Replaced hard-blocking route restrictions with an interactive advisory model.
  - All backends (**ReShade**, **OptiScaler**) and routes (**DLSS 5 Feeder**, **Native DLSS**) remain fully selectable for every game in your library.
  - Selecting an incompatible combination displays a prominent crimson alert card (**`🚨 High Incompatibility Warning`**) outlining exact technical reasons and recommended alternatives.
  - Advanced users can bypass warnings at any time using the crimson **`Deploy Anyway (Force Override) ⚠️`** action.
- **Automatic Deployment State Reflection**:
  - Opening the game detail sheet now queries active game installations on disk and faithfully restores all UI controls (**Backend**, **Route**, **Pre-SR**, **Passes**, **4x MFG**, and **Neural Rendering Style**) to reflect what is actually deployed instead of resetting to defaults.
- **Intelligent Optimal Path Auto-Selection (Vanilla Games)**:
  - Opening an unmodded game automatically selects the optimal compatible route based on its detected graphics API and bitness:
    - **DirectX 11, Vulkan, OpenGL, DirectX 9, or non-DLSS**: Automatically defaults to **DLSS 5 Feeder** (no false warnings).
    - **64-Bit DirectX 12 with native DLSS**: Defaults to **Native DLSS**.
    - **4x Multi-Frame Generation**: Defaults to off for vanilla titles.
- **Dynamic Executable Switching (Unpatched Games Only)**:
  - Switching between game executables in the dropdown automatically updates the route to match the chosen executable's optimal API path if the title is unpatched. If an active deployment already exists, settings are strictly preserved.

<summary><b>DLSS 5 Studio v1.0.1 — Hotfix Release</b></summary>

> Hotfix release restoring Neural Rendering on the DLSS 5 Feeder route and improving out-of-the-box installation defaults.

- **DLSS 5 Feeder Neural Rendering**:
  - Restored `NeuralUplift=1` in `ReShade.ini` during Feeder route deployments.
  - Resolves an issue where Neural Reconstruction (Feature 18) was initialized in a disabled state at launch, enabling seamless DLSS-NR execution across non-DX12 titles (such as DirectX 11 executables like `bg3_dx11.exe`).
- **Setup & Installation Defaults**:
  - Defaulted install directory to `C:\DLSS 5 Studio` and data directory to `C:\DLSS 5 Studio\data` for smooth, permission-friendly installs on standard user accounts without requiring elevation prompts.
  - Added real-time visual warning banners in the setup wizard when protected system directories (`Program Files`) are manually selected.
- **Documentation & Upstream Attribution**:
  - Updated OptiScaler attribution in `README.md` to credit `wilsjo2/OptiScaler-DLSSNR-PreSR-Multipass` for the Pre-SR Multipass and DLSS-NR runtime implementation.
