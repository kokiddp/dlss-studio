# DLSS 5 Studio v1.0.7 ⚡

### RTX 30 fork integration

- Integrates upstream Studio 1.0.7 while retaining the fork's experimental RTX 30 backend and deployment/recovery protections.
- Updates DLSSG SM86 to pinned 0.3.5 (`9621db573e07ed54f50c15bbb585ed9a7bdfac28`) with individually verified forwarding DLLs and notices. Upstream 0.3.5 fixes a defect present since 0.3.0 where re-creating the frame-generation feature (menu/resolution/quality changes, toggling frame generation) could use the wrong optimized inference kernel, causing corrupted generated frames or random crashes/driver resets.
- Recognizes managed 0.3.4 DLLs for in-place upgrade, rollback, and removal; new payloads must match 0.3.5. Failed upgrades recover the old installation.
- Adds 5x and 6x ceiling options to the SM86 multiplier selector, matching the 0.3.5 runtime's raised cap (`MaxGeneratedFrames` up to 5). The Ada/RTX 40 MFG-unlock route is unaffected and remains capped at 4x.
- Restores the installed SM86 multiplier in the game sheet. Renderer **Force Override** does not bypass GPU/API/native-FG, integrity, ownership, or recovery checks.
- RTX 30 support remains experimental; see [setup and validation](docs/RTX30-SM86.md).

### Upstream Studio 1.0.7 merge

- Window drag modal event fix across all screens, theme-harmonious squircle accordion trigger, high-contrast Light Theme contrast & badges, 2-second copy toast auto-dismiss timer, and complete multilingual translation coverage.

### Graphics API detection fixes

- Detect DirectX 12 via delay-load imports (e.g. Hogwarts Legacy, which statically imports `d3d11.dll` but only delay-loads `d3d12.dll` for its runtime RHI switch).
- Recognize native Frame Generation and Super Resolution DLLs shipped deep under `Engine/Plugins/Runtime/**` (Nvidia Streamline/DLSS), previously invisible to the scan's depth limit — including titles where a patch removed the shallow copy entirely (e.g. Hogwarts Legacy's DLSS detection after an update).
- Recognize LOVE (love2d.org) engine games (e.g. Kingdom Rush and its sequels) as OpenGL instead of leaving them Undetected.
- Corroborate a legacy DirectX 9 static import (e.g. Red Dead Redemption 2's vestigial `d3d9.dll` link) against marker evidence instead of trusting it outright, while still trusting an exe explicitly named for its API (e.g. Sims 4's dedicated `TS4_DX9_x64.exe`) unconditionally.
- Stop excluding standalone benchmark titles whose own exe name contains "benchmark" (e.g. Bright Memory Infinite Benchmark was previously invisible to the scanner entirely); deprioritize instead of hard-excluding so a real game exe still wins when both exist in the same folder.
- Exclude bundled JRE/JDK runtimes from candidate scanning and treat ANGLE (`libEGL`/`libGLESv2`) as CEF-adjacent middleware, fixing false DirectX 9 results caused by incidental evidence in an unrelated bundled Java runtime or an embedded browser UI (e.g. 3DMark).

> **Route advisory engine, high-contrast incompatibility warnings, unrestricted force override deployment, automatic deployment state reflection, and intelligent optimal path selection, plus window drag fixes, theme polish, and complete multilingual translation coverage.**

### 🚀 Highlights & Improvements

- **Window Drag Event Fix Across All Screens**:
  - Resolved an issue where clicks, toggles, and switches on **Add-ons**, **History**, **Settings**, and **About** screens failed to register.
  - Bounded window dragging strictly to designated header surfaces (`.toolbar`, `.brand`, and empty sidebar spacer) with native CSS drag regions (`-webkit-app-region: drag` and `no-drag !important`).
- **Theme-Harmonious Accordion Trigger (Detected Graphics Modules)**:
  - Replaced the mismatched circular glowing coin with a **20×20px rounded squircle (`border-radius: 6px`)** that mirrors the shape, scale, and left-alignment of the feature checkboxes directly above it (`chkNrStyle`, `chkMfg`).
  - Rendered with a razor-sharp 12×12px SVG chevron polyline (`stroke-width: 2.8px`) that smoothly rotates 90° on expand.
- **High-Contrast Light Theme Styling**:
  - Eliminated blurry yellow glow washes on white backgrounds.
  - Added dedicated high-contrast light theme colors for the chevron (`#9a3412` rust with `#b45309` border) and summary badges (NVIDIA, AMD, Streamline, OptiScaler).
- **Toast Feedback 2-Second Auto-Dismiss Timer**:
  - Added an automatic 2000ms dismiss timer with debounced multi-click reset and micro-animation for all copy actions across the application.
- **Complete Multilingual Translation & Terminal Status**:
  - Localized the execution log terminal status (`@{status_ready}`) and added complete translations across all 13 supported languages.
  - Cleaned up obsolete emulator references and refined modular engine runtime detection.
